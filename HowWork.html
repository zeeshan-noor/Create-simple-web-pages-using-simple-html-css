            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">We offer tuition for students from Kindergarten to college and university in Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Languages, General Science, ESL, Study Skills and Homework Assistance, and offer home support schooled tutees. 
                The interactive classroom has been particularly designed to be encouraging to learning and to assist students to focus better. With the Handout and document sharing, teachers can provide students with learning material to help them understand the topic matter better. Students can also practice this feature to share the homework assessments that they need support with.
                The tutor and tutee effort together on a one-to-one session. The tutee can inquire the teacher any queries that they might have related to the topic being discussed. All our instructors are experienced not only in their subjects they teach but also in collaborating with tutees to put them at ease so that they feel relaxed clarifying any points of confusion or doubt.
                At Face2Face tutoring, we organized our platform with the students' success in mind. We shaped a system that is most efficient for the tutees and their learning process. Our flexible choices to schedule classes, choose teachers to select from, and the wide range of subjects and domains to pick from are dedicated to the best outcome for the students.
                All Face2Face has the right to record tutoring sessions for internal, ongoing quality control purposes. (We want to make sure that we are always offering the best service and quality possible to all students.)
                Parents and guardians can get an update on how the pupil is progressing by communicating with the tutor.
